                  As the first woman to go to space for NASA, Sally Ride pioneer... and dedication? her lifelong passion for accessible science education for women and girls.??? 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sally Ride was born on 26th May 1951 in Los Angeles, California and went on to study Shakespeare and quantum mechanics at the University of California before transferring to Stanford University to earn a degree in not only physics but also English literature.   
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sally worked as a ground-based capsule communicator…  
                </p>
                <p>  
                  Ride wrote 'To Space and Back' with Susan Okie, a children’s book published in 1986 documenting her own experience of going to space and the challenges she faced being in an environment which is so different to that of Earth.   
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, Ride left NASA to pursue her own interests, becoming a professor at the University of California in 1989 and advocating for equal opportunities in girls' education in science. The professor went on to co-found Sally Ride Science. This educational outreach program aims to inspire young people to pursue STEM careers by hosting workshops and camps, as well as offering online resources.   
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sally Ride passed away at the age of 61 on 23rd July 2012 after a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer. It was not until after her passing that Ride's obituary revealed that Tam O'Shaughnessy and Ride had been in a romantic, long-term relationship.

              <div class="collapser-body">
                <h4>Why solidification behaves differently in space than on Earth</h4>
                <p>
                  On Earth molten metals and alloys are able solidify but not without the effects convection has on their
                  particles. This is because buoyancy forces arise due to gravitational forces acting on particles with
                  different densities. Essentially, this means that there is a constant flow within the material and thus
                  crystal growth is distorted and cooling becomes uneven.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However in microgravity, where the gravitational forces are negligible, this convection current disappears as
                  there are no gravitationally dependent buoyancy forces. This means all movement within the solidification
                  process must be down to diffusion and thus this gives us the most natural way in which these crystalline
                  structures form.
                </p>

                <h4>Directional solidification</h4>
                <p>
                  The most prominent method used on the ISS to experiment with solidification is to melt an alloy while
                  applying a temperature gradient along it so once one end cools it creates a solidification front which moves
                  along the sample allowing us to observe crystal growth. This crystalline growth travels along the material as
                  it cools down so we can observe this solidification as a slow wave.
                </p>

                <h4>Why microgravity changes what we can learn</h4>
                <p>
                  (To be expanded in the final draft: link microgravity solidification to cleaner microstructures, better
                  models, and applications to turbine blades, castings, and high-performance alloys on Earth.)

                <h3>Astrobee: The ISS Robot Shaping the Future of Space Engineering</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
              </button>
              <div class="collapser-body">
                <p>
                  The Astrobee robots themselves are primarily constructed from aluminum for the core frame, with propulsion
                  module plenums that are largely 3D printed using lightweight Windform XT. The exterior is covered with an
                  impact-absorbing foam shell to ensure safety during potential collisions in the International Space Station
                  (ISS).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Onboard the International Space Station, among the astronauts and science experiments, floats a cube-shaped
                  robot named Astrobee — a glimpse into the future of space engineering and robotics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Developed by NASA, Astrobee is a free-flying robotic assistant designed to operate autonomously in
                  microgravity. Roughly the size of a shoebox, it uses small electric fans to glide smoothly through the
                  station’s modules, no wheels or thrusters required. Equipped with cameras and sensors, Astrobee can navigate
                  the ISS, capture photos and video, monitor equipment, and even run routine checks — freeing astronauts to
                  focus on more complex tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But Astrobee’s role goes beyond convenience. It serves as a testbed for next-generation robotics, providing
                  valuable insights into how autonomous systems can operate safely and efficiently in space. Engineers on Earth
                  can remotely control the robot, experimenting with new algorithms for navigation and communication that could
                  one day be used on missions to the Moon and Mars.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Tucked inside the International Space Station is a trio of cube-shaped robots—Honey, Bumble, and Queen—that
                  do far more than float around looking cute. NASA’s Astrobee system is a full robotics testbed: free fliers, a
                  docking/charging station, and software that lets engineers on Earth push new algorithms and payloads into
                  orbit.
                </p>

                <h4>How it flies</h4>
                <p>
                  Each 12.5-inch cube draws cabin air through fans and pushes it out of 12 fixed nozzles, giving
                  six-degree-of-freedom control without propellant. Vision-based navigation and an onboard computer (running
                  ROS-based flight software) let Astrobee operate autonomously or under teleoperation from the ground. When the
                  battery runs low, it returns to a two-berth docking station to recharge.
                </p>

                <h4>The perching arm: free flying meets manipulation</h4>
                <p>
                  A fold-out perching arm can grab ISS handrails to save energy, hold tools, or steady sensors during delicate
                  measurements. Recent research has extended that arm with a compact, underactuated rigid-soft gripper that can
                  grasp objects (think: a 2 mm screwdriver) in microgravity, opening the door to real station “handiwork,” not
                  just inspection.
                </p>

                <h4>What it actually does all day</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Mobile camera &amp; inspection:</strong> document experiments, check hardware, and provide extra
                    “eyes” in tight spots.</li>
                  <li><strong>Inventory by RFID:</strong> scan RFID-tagged tools and supplies to keep track of thousands of
                    items.</li>
                  <li><strong>Listening for trouble (SoundSee):</strong> acoustic monitoring of pumps, fans, and valves to flag
                    anomalies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Autonomous caretaking trials (ISAAC):</strong> multiple Astrobees coordinating surveys and anomaly
                    detection without astronauts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Why this matters to engineering and robotics</h4>
                <p>
                  It’s a systems-engineering playground in real microgravity: vision, control, autonomy, human–robot
                  interaction, manipulation, and power management all under tight safety constraints. Guest scientists ship code
                  or 1U hardware payloads, then run experiments on orbit—faster than waiting for a dedicated satellite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Astrobee’s modular architecture, payload bays, open software stack, and ground tools turn the ISS into a
                  living lab for algorithms that later migrate to deep-space habitats or planetary robots. Astrobee isn’t just a
                  helper; it’s a way to try real robotics in space, from SLAM and autonomy to soft-robot grippers and AI
                  diagnostics.

                <h4>What is Nomex?</h4>
                <p>
                  Invented by Dr. Wilfrid Sweeny in the 1960s, Nomex is a flame resistant fibre. It is produced by condensation
                  polymerisation, where meta-phenylenediamine and isophthaloyl chloride react in a solvent to create a solution
                  known as dope—an aromatic polyamide with aromatic rings. Dry and wet spinning are then used to create the
                  fibre.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nomex charrs rather than burns and is used extensively across industries such as firefighting and emergency
                  response, manufacturing, aerospace and automotive. It is used on the ISS for its flame resistance, lightweight
                  strength and durability.
                </p>

                <h4>How does Nomex work?</h4>
                <p>
                  When Nomex is exposed to heat, the fibres thicken and carbonise, which absorbs some heat energy. The molecular
                  structure of Nomex means that heat and electricity cannot flow through it, making it useful for electric arc
                  flash protection and as an electrical insulator.
                </p>

                <h4>Benefits and uses of Nomex</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Chemical resistant, heat resistant, electricity resistant.</li>
                  <li>Nomex honeycomb: Nomex aramid paper bonded with phenolic resin, used in applications such as lightweight
                    furniture and panels.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Uses of Nomex on the ISS</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Reinforcement in spacesuits used on spacewalks, especially where heavy metal loads are carried.</li>
                  <li>Fire safety in oxygen-rich environments, in case of a fire event.</li>

                <h3>NICER: Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>

                <p>
                  The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, is an X-ray telescope on the ISS that primarily
                  studies the cores of neutron stars. Its mission objectives are to investigate the state of matter within the
                  star's interior, measure radii to an uncertainty of ±5%, reveal the stability of pulsars as clocks, research
                  the properties of matter outbursts, and understand how much energy is extracted from the intrinsic radiation,
                  spectra, and luminosities of the star.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The design of the telescope is very intentional. NICER needed to be sensitive to the vibrations and jolts of
                  the ISS, but insensitive to contamination and radiation from the space station. It needed to compress to stow
                  safely, yet provide a high observing efficiency, up to ~65%. It can measure the arrival of each X-ray within
                  100 nanoseconds.
                </p>

                <h4>Condensed-matter physics in a star’s core</h4>
                <p>
                  The research value of the core of neutron stars is in condensed state physics. Astrophysicists predict that
                  the interior exhibits superfluidity, meaning that the core is a liquid-like plasma with zero viscosity due to
                  its extremely high density and low temperatures. This “liquid” also means that the neutron star has
                  differential rotation, where different bands of the star rotate at different speeds. Momentum transfer in this
                  superfluid is created by scattering of electrons off neutrons bound to the superfluid's vortex cores.
                </p>

                <p>
                  NICER has made discoveries about this inner core of neutron stars, revealing what happens to matter on the
                  verge of imploding into a black hole. Neutron star J0740 showed that the core’s density crushes neutrons close
                  together, but further research is needed to confirm whether the neutrons stay intact or break down into
                  quarks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To put this density into perspective, a neutron star's mass is around 1.4× our Sun's, but the average radius is
                  only around 10–13 km. This extremely high density, and thus strong gravity, distorts spacetime around it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As soon as a neutron star collapses into a black hole, we lose all information we could gather about the exotic
                  matter it's composed of. NICER allows scientists to make groundbreaking physics research about these
                  rapidly-rotating stars in our Universe.

                <h3>Cold Atom Laboratory: Bose–Einstein Condensates in Orbit</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
              </button>

                <p>
                  The Cold Atom Laboratory was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in May 2018. Its primary goal is
                  to study exotic states of matter that are difficult to observe on Earth for extended periods of time. One such
                  state occurs in gases cooled to extremely low temperatures, where the motion of atoms slows dramatically. At
                  these temperatures atoms no longer behave like individual particles but instead act like waves that overlap and
                  merge into a single, unified quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Conducting this research in space provides a key advantage. On Earth, the force of gravity causes the
                  condensate to disperse very quickly. However, in the microgravity environment of the ISS, the atomic “cloud”
                  can remain stable for much longer periods. This extended observation time allows scientists to perform more
                  precise measurements and experiments, deepening our understanding of quantum phenomena.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the experiments conducted by the Cold Atom Laboratory involves the creation of dual-species Bose–Einstein
                  condensates, which contain two different types of atoms within the same system. This was accomplished using
                  isotopes of rubidium and potassium through a process known as sympathetic cooling.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In sympathetic cooling, one atomic species that can be easily cooled by conventional techniques is used to cool
                  another species that is more difficult to bring to such low temperatures. On the ISS, the rubidium atoms were
                  first cooled through evaporative cooling, a process in which the most energetic atoms are allowed to escape,
                  lowering the average temperature of the remaining atoms. These ultracold rubidium atoms were then used to cool
                  the potassium atoms through direct thermal contact, enabling both species to reach the ultra-low temperatures
                  necessary to form condensates.
