            <h2>Mission Purpose</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            The International Space Station is the most advanced microgravity laboratory for human space operations. Since the first human-boarded flight in 2000, the ISS has conducted 25 years of research and hosted over 3,500 experiments and investigations. The ISS has produced more than 3.5 million photographs of the Earth, conducted studies in DNA sequencing and genome editing, advancing hygiene technology such as shampoo, testing new drugs and medicine, robotics, and so much more. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart of the science operations in the ISS is physics. Microgravity conditions allow physicists to remove the fog of gravity that is present in every experiment on Earth. Scientists have discovered incredible observations about fluid behaviour, subatomic particles, and crystalline structure. The ISS, importantly, has allowed us to study astrophysical processes in low Earth orbit. The station has been able to observe black hole eruptions, investigate dark matter through cosmic rays, and advance the study of gamma-ray physics of high-energy phenomena.
          </p>

          <p>
            The International Space Station is the Earth's largest international program in science and technology. The main assembly required cooperation over the span of 13 years with the efforts of 15 countries through 40 missions. Each piece of the ISS had to be taken into space individually and built in orbit 400 km above the Earth's surface. The mission purpose of the International Space Station is to inspire the next generation of scientists, continuing scientific research on everything the environment of microgravity can aid with.

                  As the first woman to fly to space for NASA, Sally Ride was a pioneer in gender equality and a lifelong advocate for providing science education to young people, especially girls. Ride left an inspirational legacy, including non-profit charities in her name and a plethora of science books.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Sally Ride was born on the 26th of May, 1951, in Los Angeles, California and went on to study Shakespeare and quantum mechanics at the University of California before transferring to Stanford University to earn a degree in not only physics but also English literature.   
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sally was the first woman to work as a ground-based capsule communicator and was involved in the development of the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System, also known as the robot arm. Due to Ride's involvement with RMS, as well as her work as a capsule communicator, she was selected as a member of the STS-7 Space Shuttle mission. This mission was designed to position two communication satellites, one for Canada and the other for Indonesia, as well as being the first shuttle to conduct ten experiments on metal alloys in microgravity.  
                  Soon after, Ride was assigned to STS-41-G, a mission to deploy more satellites, making Ride the first woman to fly to space twice. The RMS was used several times by Ride to swiftly resolve problems with faulty equipment. Sally Ride spent 343 hours in space over her flights.  
                </p>
                <p>  
                  After her flights, Ride wrote 'To Space and Back' with Susan Okie, a children's book published in 1986, documenting her own experience of going to space and the challenges she faced being in an environment which is so different to that of Earth. Ride went on to write over ten books, frequently collaborating with childhood friend Tam O'Shaughnessy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, Ride left NASA to pursue her own interests, becoming a professor at the University of California in 1989 and advocating for equal opportunities for girls' education in the sciences. The professor went on to co-found Sally Ride Science. This educational outreach program aims to inspire young people to pursue STEM careers by hosting workshops and camps, as well as offering online resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sally Ride passed away at the age of 61 on 23rd July 2012 after a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer. It was not until after her passing that Ride's obituary revealed that Tam O'Shaughnessy and Ride had been in a romantic, long-term relationship, which made Sally also the first known LGBTQ astronaut.

                <h3>Solidification in Microgravity</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
              </button>
              <div class="collapser-body">
                <h4>Why solidification behaves differently in space than on Earth</h4>
                <p>
                  On earth molten metals and alloys are able solidify but not without the effects convection has its particles. This is because buoyancy forces arise due to gravitational forces acting on particles with different densities. Essentially, this means that there is a constant flow within the material and thus crystal growth is distorted and cooling becomes uneven.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However in microgravity where the gravitational forces are negligible this convection current disappears as there are no gravitationally dependent buoyancy forces. This means all movement within the solidification process must be down to diffusion and thus this gives us the most natural or "pure" way in which these crystalline structures form. 
                </p>

                <h4>Directional solidification</h4>
                <p>
                  The most prominent method used on the ISS to experiment with solidification is to melt an alloy while applying a temperature gradient along it so once one end cools it creates a solidification front which moves along the sample allowing us to observe crystal growth. This crystalline growth travels along the material as it cool down so we can observe this solidification as a slow wave.
                </p>

                
                <p>
                  Due to this front moving slowly it allows us to observe how dendrites from and how solute is rejected into the still liquid part of the sample. 
                </p>


                <p>
                  Dendrites are a structure which forms once the metal solidifies and can be imagined to look similarly to snowflakes or branches which branch out from the centre of the crystal. This is significant as the specific way these grow allow for different properties in the final solid metal. 
                  Solute is simply an element which is added to the main metal in much lower quantity. However, solute doesn't always fit within the final crystal structure so to mitigate this problem the solidifying metal may push it out as it becomes a solid. This can build up on the crystal front leading to defect in the metals solid state after it interferes with the dendrites shape. Then given as it can change the dendrites formed shape and thus the properties of the metal the redistribution of solute is one of the most important aspects to study in these microgravity solidification experiments. 
                </p>


                <h4>Why it all matters on Earth</h4>
                <p>
                  Solidification within Microgravity is significant as it essentially allows us to see the most accurate way in which metals form crystalline growth as if they were left on their own without gravity or buoyancy forces there to disturb the process. This allows us to refine simulations for casting components in the aerospace and automotive industries such as giving us better models for single-crystal turbine blade growth.

                <h3>Astrobee: The ISS Robot Shaping the Future of Space Engineering</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
              </button>
              <div class="collapser-body">
                <p>
                  On the International Space Station (ISS), three cube-shaped robots: Honey, Bumble, and Queen, float through the modules helping astronauts. They’re called Astrobee, and they test how autonomous robots can navigate, inspect equipment, and even manipulate objects in microgravity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each unit is roughly the size of a shoebox, with an aluminum core and 3D‑printed Windform XT(Carbon fiber filled composite material polyamide based) components wrapped in a foam shell to keep the crew and delicate equipment safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead of wheels, Astrobee propels: electric fans pull in cabin air and push it out through twelve fixed nozzles, allowing motion in six degrees of freedom. By balancing this airflow, the robot can move forward and back, drift left and right, rise and sink, and rotate about roll, pitch, and yaw with precision. A navigation system maps its surroundings, avoids obstacles, follows the routes, and pilots the robot back to a docking station whenever its battery runs low. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  In orbit, motion continues unless something stops it, efficient puffs of air are enough for precise maneuvers. 
                  Astrobee is a laboratory for space robotics. Engineers on the ground can teleoperate it in real time or upload new algorithms that let the robot plan, navigate, and diagnose problems on its own. This turns the ISS into a testbed where software and small hardware can be tried in real microgravity, long before they are entrusted with duties on lunar stations or deep‑space vehicles. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of its signature capabilities is its perching arm since some tasks demand stillness or leverage. The arm lets the robot attach onto ISS handrails, saving power while holding steady for inspections and measurements. It can also manipulate small objects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the SoundSee payload developed by Bosch and Astrobotic, the robot becomes an acoustic inspector, learning the healthy sound signatures of fans, pumps, and valves and flagging anomalies before something fails.  
                </p>

                <p>
                  Material and design choices reflect life in orbit.  Its aluminum frame spreads heat by thermal conduction (hot regions pass energy to cooler ones), which is important in microgravity where air doesn’t circulate much. The foam shell is viscoelastic: when it gets bumped, it squishes and springs back, turning some impact energy into heat, so collisions are gentler. The SoundSee payload listens for changes in resonance (how parts naturally vibrate).  The robot returns, aligns magnetically, and recharges while syncing data at the Dock, readying itself for the next task. The algorithms, tools, and habits being formed now will travel with us to the lunar Gateway and, eventually, to the pressurized decks of ships bound for Mars. 
                </p>

                
                <h4>What it actually does all day</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Mobile camera &amp; inspection:</strong> document experiments, check hardware, and provide extra
                    “eyes” in tight spots.</li>
                  <li><strong>Inventory by RFID:</strong> scan RFID-tagged tools and supplies to keep track of thousands of
                    items.</li>
                  <li><strong>Listening for trouble (SoundSee):</strong> acoustic monitoring of pumps, fans, and valves to flag
                    anomalies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Autonomous caretaking trials (ISAAC):</strong> multiple Astrobees coordinating surveys and anomaly
                    detection without astronauts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Why this matters to engineering and robotics</h4>
                <p>
                  It’s a systems-engineering playground in real microgravity: vision, control, autonomy, human–robot
                  interaction, manipulation, and power management all under tight safety constraints. Guest scientists ship code
                  or 1U hardware payloads, then run experiments on orbit—faster than waiting for a dedicated satellite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Astrobee’s modular architecture, payload bays, open software stack, and ground tools turn the ISS into a
                  living lab for algorithms that later migrate to deep-space habitats or planetary robots. Astrobee isn’t just a
                  helper; it’s a way to try real robotics in space, from SLAM and autonomy to soft-robot grippers and AI
                  diagnostics.

                <h3>Solidification in Microgravity</h3>

              <div class="collapser-body">
                <h4>Why solidification behaves differently in space than on Earth</h4>
                <p>
                  On earth molten metals and alloys are able solidify but not without the effects convection has its particles. This is because buoyancy forces arise due to gravitational forces acting on particles with different densities. Essentially, this means that there is a constant flow within the material and thus crystal growth is distorted and cooling becomes uneven.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However in microgravity where the gravitational forces are negligible this convection current disappears as there are no gravitationally dependent buoyancy forces. This means all movement within the solidification process must be down to diffusion and thus this gives us the most natural or "pure" way in which these crystalline structures form. 
                </p>

                <h4>Directional solidification</h4>
                <p>
                  The most prominent method used on the ISS to experiment with solidification is to melt an alloy while applying a temperature gradient along it so once one end cools it creates a solidification front which moves along the sample allowing us to observe crystal growth. This crystalline growth travels along the material as it cool down so we can observe this solidification as a slow wave.
                </p>

                
                <p>
                  Due to this front moving slowly it allows us to observe how dendrites from and how solute is rejected into the still liquid part of the sample. 
                </p>


                <p>
                  Dendrites are a structure which forms once the metal solidifies and can be imagined to look similarly to snowflakes or branches which branch out from the centre of the crystal. This is significant as the specific way these grow allow for different properties in the final solid metal. 
                  Solute is simply an element which is added to the main metal in much lower quantity. However, solute doesn't always fit within the final crystal structure so to mitigate this problem the solidifying metal may push it out as it becomes a solid. This can build up on the crystal front leading to defect in the metals solid state after it interferes with the dendrites shape. Then given as it can change the dendrites formed shape and thus the properties of the metal the redistribution of solute is one of the most important aspects to study in these microgravity solidification experiments. 
                </p>


                <h4>Why it all matters on Earth</h4>
                <p>
                  Solidification within Microgravity is significant as it essentially allows us to see the most accurate way in which metals form crystalline growth as if they were left on their own without gravity or buoyancy forces there to disturb the process. This allows us to refine simulations for casting components in the aerospace and automotive industries such as giving us better models for single-crystal turbine blade growth.

                <h3>Astrobee: The ISS Robot Shaping the Future of Space Engineering</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>

                  On the International Space Station (ISS), three cube-shaped robots: Honey, Bumble, and Queen, float through the modules helping astronauts. They’re called Astrobee, and they test how autonomous robots can navigate, inspect equipment, and even manipulate objects in microgravity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each unit is roughly the size of a shoebox, with an aluminum core and 3D‑printed Windform XT(Carbon fiber filled composite material polyamide based) components wrapped in a foam shell to keep the crew and delicate equipment safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead of wheels, Astrobee propels: electric fans pull in cabin air and push it out through twelve fixed nozzles, allowing motion in six degrees of freedom. By balancing this airflow, the robot can move forward and back, drift left and right, rise and sink, and rotate about roll, pitch, and yaw with precision. A navigation system maps its surroundings, avoids obstacles, follows the routes, and pilots the robot back to a docking station whenever its battery runs low. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  In orbit, motion continues unless something stops it, efficient puffs of air are enough for precise maneuvers. 
                  Astrobee is a laboratory for space robotics. Engineers on the ground can teleoperate it in real time or upload new algorithms that let the robot plan, navigate, and diagnose problems on its own. This turns the ISS into a testbed where software and small hardware can be tried in real microgravity, long before they are entrusted with duties on lunar stations or deep‑space vehicles. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of its signature capabilities is its perching arm since some tasks demand stillness or leverage. The arm lets the robot attach onto ISS handrails, saving power while holding steady for inspections and measurements. It can also manipulate small objects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the SoundSee payload developed by Bosch and Astrobotic, the robot becomes an acoustic inspector, learning the healthy sound signatures of fans, pumps, and valves and flagging anomalies before something fails.  
                </p>

                <p>
                  Material and design choices reflect life in orbit.  Its aluminum frame spreads heat by thermal conduction (hot regions pass energy to cooler ones), which is important in microgravity where air doesn’t circulate much. The foam shell is viscoelastic: when it gets bumped, it squishes and springs back, turning some impact energy into heat, so collisions are gentler. The SoundSee payload listens for changes in resonance (how parts naturally vibrate).  The robot returns, aligns magnetically, and recharges while syncing data at the Dock, readying itself for the next task. The algorithms, tools, and habits being formed now will travel with us to the lunar Gateway and, eventually, to the pressurized decks of ships bound for Mars.

                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>

                <p>
                  The ISS is constantly fighting against the extreme conditions of space, such as the exterior temperature of the ISS oscillating between 121°C when in direct sunlight and -157°C when in the shadows. This means that to keep the ISS functioning and protect the people and equipment within, some extreme materials are required. One of these materials is Nomex, a flame and heat-resistant fibre.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Nomex was invented in the 1960s by Dr Wilfred Sweeny, working for the company DuPont, to prevent further deaths caused by crashes that caught fire in racing. Chemicals m-phenylenediamine and isophthaloyl chloride react by condensation polymerisation to create a solution of dope-aromatic polyamide, before undergoing dry and wet spinning to create the Nomex fibre.  
                  When Nomex is exposed to heat, the fibres thicken and carbonise, forming a protective layer; instead of melting, this protects what is underneath the material and insulates it from the heat.  
                  These properties of Nomex are attributed to the structure of the molecule, specifically the aromatic rings, which are strongly bonded and stable, enabling it to withstand degradation under intense heat.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  One of the most well-known instances of Nomex saving a life is the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, where, on the first lap, driver Romain Grosjean lost control after making contact with another car and crashing into the barrier at 192km/h; the Haas VF-20 ignited on impact. Grosjean was trapped for 28 seconds before escaping the fire. The driver escaped with the only injuries he sustained being second-degree burns to his hands, which is credited to the Nomex racing suits and undergarments, as well as the halo. As a result, gloves were then redesigned to increase fire resistance while maintaining the current level of dexterity drivers require for mechanical input into the wheel and steering itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Nomex has several applications on the ISS, including spacesuits and crew sleeping kits. The Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuit provides the user with protection from the environment, as well as communication and mobility, while participating in spacewalks outside the ISS. The outer layer is made from Ortho Fabric, which is composed of Nomex and Kevlar for strength and durability, as well as Gore-Tex for its waterproof and breathable properties. Ortho Fabric is able to withstand extreme temperatures, micrometeoroid protection and general wear and tear, which means the space suits can be reused.  
                  The sleeping bags used by the crew on board the ISS are constructed with a tightly woven Nomex fabric outer shell to protect against fire and an elastic Nomex inner shell. This style of sleeping bag was chosen over others for its soft inside and rigid outside, as well as being allergen-friendly.

                  The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, is an x-ray telescope on the ISS that primarily studies the core neutron stars. The mission objectives are to investigate the state of matter within the star's interior, measure the radii to an uncertainty of +-5%, reveal the stability of pulsars as clocks, research the properties of matter outbursts, and to understand how much energy is extracted from the intrinsic radiation, spectra, and luminosities of the star. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  The design of the telescope is very intentional. NICER needed to be sensitive of the vibrations and jolts of the ISS, but insensitive to the contamination and radiation from the space station. It needed to compress to stow safely, but provide a high observing efficiency, up to 65%. It can measure the arrival of each x-ray within 100 nanoseconds. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  The research value of the core of neutron stars is in condensed state physics. Astrophysicists predict that the interior exhibits superfluidity, which means that the core is a liquid-like plasma that has zero viscosity from an extremely high density with low temperatures. This 'liquid' also means that the neutron star has differential rotation, where different bands of the star rotate at different speeds. The momentum transfer in this superfluid is created by the scattering of electrons off of neutrons bound to the superfluid's vortex core. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  NICER has made quite a few discoveries about this inner core of neutron stars, as they reveal what happens to matter on the verge of imploding into a black hole. Neutron star J0740 revealed that the core's density crushes neutrons close together-- but further research needs to confirm if the neutrons stay intact, or if they break down into quarks. To put this density into perspective, a neutron star's mass is around 1.4x our Sun's, but the average radius is around 10-13 kilometers. This extremely high density, which in turn makes a great force of gravity, distorts space time around it.  
                </p>

                <p>
                  As soon as a neutron star collapses into a black hole, we lose all information we could gather about the exotic matter it's composed of. NICER allows scientists to make groundbreaking physics research about these rapidly-rotating stars in our Universe.

                  The Cold Atom Laboratory was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in May 2018. Its primary goal is to study exotic states of matter that are difficult to observe on Earth for extended periods of time. One such state occurs in gases cooled to extremely low temperatures, where the motion of atoms slows dramatically. At these temperatures atoms no longer behave like individual particles but instead act like waves that overlap and merge into a single, unified quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Conducting this research in space provides a key advantage. On Earth, the force of gravity causes the condensate to disperse very quickly. However, in the microgravity environment of the ISS, the atomic “cloud” can remain stable for much longer periods. This extended observation time allows scientists to perform more precise measurements and experiments, deepening our understanding of quantum phenomena. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the experiments conducted by the Cold Atom Laboratory involves the creation of dual-species Bose–Einstein condensates, which contain two different types of atoms within the same system. This was accomplished using isotopes of rubidium and potassium through a process known as sympathetic cooling.

                  In sympathetic cooling, one atomic species that can be easily cooled by conventional techniques is used to cool another species that is more difficult to bring to such low temperatures. On the ISS, the rubidium atoms were first cooled through evaporative cooling, a process in which the most energetic atoms are allowed to escape, lowering the average temperature of the remaining atoms. These ultracold rubidium atoms were then used to cool the potassium atoms through direct thermal contact, enabling both species to reach the ultra-low temperatures necessary to form condensates.

                <p>
                  The Sally Ride EarthKAM was created for middle school students to request images of specific locations on Earth. The EarthKAM, a Nikon D2Xs digital camera, is mounted in the Window Observational Research Facility in the U.S. Destiny Laboratory on a downward-facing window.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Since its first image was captured in March 2001, the EarthKAM has taken about 80,000 photos of the Earth for over 165,000 students from 41 different countries. The middle school students send in requests, which are given to college students at the University of California in San Diego. They run the EarthKAM Missions Operations Center at the university. The requests are compiled and uplinked to a computer aboard the ISS with the help of NASA's Johnson Space Center. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  The goal of the EarthKAM is to help students learn about geography and Earth science in a hands-on experience through the ISS. NASA aims to excite a new generation of scientists and engineers to pursue careers in STEM fields. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  The program was originally known as KidSat. NASA honored Sally Ride through naming the EarthKAM in her memory. She was the founder of the project, along with being a lifelong advocate for STEM education in students.
