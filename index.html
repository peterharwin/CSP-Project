            <h2>Mission Purpose</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            The International Space Station is the most advanced microgravity laboratory for human space operations. Since the first human-boarded flight in 2000, the ISS has conducted 25 years of research and hosted over 3,500 experiments and investigations. The ISS has produced more than 3.5 million photographs of the Earth, conducted studies in DNA sequencing and genome editing, advancing hygiene technology such as shampoo, testing new drugs and medicine, robotics, and so much more. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart of the science operations in the ISS is physics. Microgravity conditions allow physicists to remove the fog of gravity that is present in every experiment on Earth. Scientists have discovered incredible observations about fluid behaviour, subatomic particles, and crystalline structure. The ISS, importantly, has allowed us to study astrophysical processes in low Earth orbit. The station has been able to observe black hole eruptions, investigate dark matter through cosmic rays, and advance the study of gamma-ray physics of high-energy phenomena.
          </p>

          <p>
            The International Space Station is the Earth's largest international program in science and technology. The main assembly required cooperation over the span of 13 years with the efforts of 15 countries through 40 missions. Each piece of the ISS had to be taken into space individually and built in orbit 400 km above the Earth's surface. The mission purpose of the International Space Station is to inspire the next generation of scientists, continuing scientific research on everything the environment of microgravity can aid with.

                  As the first woman to fly to space for NASA, Sally Ride was a pioneer in gender equality and a lifelong advocate for providing science education to young people, especially girls. Ride left an inspirational legacy, including non-profit charities in her name and a plethora of science books.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Sally Ride was born on the 26th of May, 1951, in Los Angeles, California and went on to study Shakespeare and quantum mechanics at the University of California before transferring to Stanford University to earn a degree in not only physics but also English literature.   
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sally was the first woman to work as a ground-based capsule communicator and was involved in the development of the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System, also known as the robot arm. Due to Ride's involvement with RMS, as well as her work as a capsule communicator, she was selected as a member of the STS-7 Space Shuttle mission. This mission was designed to position two communication satellites, one for Canada and the other for Indonesia, as well as being the first shuttle to conduct ten experiments on metal alloys in microgravity.  
                  Soon after, Ride was assigned to STS-41-G, a mission to deploy more satellites, making Ride the first woman to fly to space twice. The RMS was used several times by Ride to swiftly resolve problems with faulty equipment. Sally Ride spent 343 hours in space over her flights.  
                </p>
                <p>  
                  After her flights, Ride wrote 'To Space and Back' with Susan Okie, a children's book published in 1986, documenting her own experience of going to space and the challenges she faced being in an environment which is so different to that of Earth. Ride went on to write over ten books, frequently collaborating with childhood friend Tam O'Shaughnessy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, Ride left NASA to pursue her own interests, becoming a professor at the University of California in 1989 and advocating for equal opportunities for girls' education in the sciences. The professor went on to co-found Sally Ride Science. This educational outreach program aims to inspire young people to pursue STEM careers by hosting workshops and camps, as well as offering online resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sally Ride passed away at the age of 61 on 23rd July 2012 after a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer. It was not until after her passing that Ride's obituary revealed that Tam O'Shaughnessy and Ride had been in a romantic, long-term relationship, which made Sally also the first known LGBTQ astronaut.

                <h3>Solidification in Microgravity</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
              </button>
              <div class="collapser-body">
                <h4>Why solidification behaves differently in space than on Earth</h4>
                <p>
                  On Earth molten metals and alloys are able solidify but not without the effects convection has on their
                  particles. This is because buoyancy forces arise due to gravitational forces acting on particles with
                  different densities. Essentially, this means that there is a constant flow within the material and thus
                  crystal growth is distorted and cooling becomes uneven.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, in microgravity where the gravitational forces are negligible this convection current disappears as it becomes 
                  negligable once there are no gravitationally dependent buoyancy forces. This means all movement within the solidification
                  process must be down to diffusion and thus this gives us the most natural and "purest" way in which these crystalline
                  structures form.
                </p>

                <h4>Directional solidification</h4>
                <p>
                  The most prominent method used on the ISS to experiment with solidification is to melt an alloy while
                  giving it a temperature gradient so once one end cools it creates a solidification front which moves
                  along the sample allowing us to observe crystal growth. This crystalline growth travels along the material as
                  it cools giving us the ability to observe this solidification as a slow wave.
                </p>

                <h4>Why microgravity changes what we can learn</h4>
                <p>
                  (To be expanded in the final draft: link microgravity solidification to cleaner microstructures, better
                  models, and applications to turbine blades, castings, and high-performance alloys on Earth.)

                <h3>Astrobee: The ISS Robot Shaping the Future of Space Engineering</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
              </button>
              <div class="collapser-body">
                <p>
                  On the International Space Station (ISS), three cube-shaped robots: Honey, Bumble, and Queen, float through the modules helping astronauts. They’re called Astrobee, and they test how autonomous robots can navigate, inspect equipment, and even manipulate objects in microgravity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each unit is roughly the size of a shoebox, with an aluminum core and 3D‑printed Windform XT(Carbon fiber filled composite material polyamide based) components wrapped in a foam shell to keep the crew and delicate equipment safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead of wheels, Astrobee propels: electric fans pull in cabin air and push it out through twelve fixed nozzles, allowing motion in six degrees of freedom. By balancing this airflow, the robot can move forward and back, drift left and right, rise and sink, and rotate about roll, pitch, and yaw with precision. A navigation system maps its surroundings, avoids obstacles, follows the routes, and pilots the robot back to a docking station whenever its battery runs low. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  In orbit, motion continues unless something stops it, efficient puffs of air are enough for precise maneuvers. 
                  Astrobee is a laboratory for space robotics. Engineers on the ground can teleoperate it in real time or upload new algorithms that let the robot plan, navigate, and diagnose problems on its own. This turns the ISS into a testbed where software and small hardware can be tried in real microgravity, long before they are entrusted with duties on lunar stations or deep‑space vehicles. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of its signature capabilities is its perching arm since some tasks demand stillness or leverage. The arm lets the robot attach onto ISS handrails, saving power while holding steady for inspections and measurements. It can also manipulate small objects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the SoundSee payload developed by Bosch and Astrobotic, the robot becomes an acoustic inspector, learning the healthy sound signatures of fans, pumps, and valves and flagging anomalies before something fails.  
                </p>

                <p>
                  Material and design choices reflect life in orbit.  Its aluminum frame spreads heat by thermal conduction (hot regions pass energy to cooler ones), which is important in microgravity where air doesn’t circulate much. The foam shell is viscoelastic: when it gets bumped, it squishes and springs back, turning some impact energy into heat, so collisions are gentler. The SoundSee payload listens for changes in resonance (how parts naturally vibrate).  The robot returns, aligns magnetically, and recharges while syncing data at the Dock, readying itself for the next task. The algorithms, tools, and habits being formed now will travel with us to the lunar Gateway and, eventually, to the pressurized decks of ships bound for Mars. 
                </p>

                <h4>Why this matters to engineering and robotics</h4>
                <p>
                  It’s a systems-engineering playground in real microgravity: vision, control, autonomy, human–robot
                  interaction, manipulation, and power management all under tight safety constraints. Guest scientists ship code
                  or 1U hardware payloads, then run experiments on orbit—faster than waiting for a dedicated satellite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Astrobee’s modular architecture, payload bays, open software stack, and ground tools turn the ISS into a
                  living lab for algorithms that later migrate to deep-space habitats or planetary robots. Astrobee isn’t just a
                  helper; it’s a way to try real robotics in space, from SLAM and autonomy to soft-robot grippers and AI
                  diagnostics.

                <h4>What is Nomex?</h4>
                <p>
                  Invented by Dr. Wilfrid Sweeny in the 1960s, Nomex is a flame resistant fibre. It is produced by condensation
                  polymerisation, where meta-phenylenediamine and isophthaloyl chloride react in a solvent to create a solution
                  known as dope—an aromatic polyamide with aromatic rings. Dry and wet spinning are then used to create the
                  fibre.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nomex charrs rather than burns and is used extensively across industries such as firefighting and emergency
                  response, manufacturing, aerospace and automotive. It is used on the ISS for its flame resistance, lightweight
                  strength and durability.
                </p>

                <h4>How does Nomex work?</h4>
                <p>
                  When Nomex is exposed to heat, the fibres thicken and carbonise, which absorbs some heat energy. The molecular
                  structure of Nomex means that heat and electricity cannot flow through it, making it useful for electric arc
                  flash protection and as an electrical insulator.
                </p>

                <h4>Benefits and uses of Nomex</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Chemical resistant, heat resistant, electricity resistant.</li>
                  <li>Nomex honeycomb: Nomex aramid paper bonded with phenolic resin, used in applications such as lightweight

                <h3>NICER: Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>

                  The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, is an X-ray telescope on the ISS that primarily
                  studies the cores of neutron stars. Its mission objectives are to investigate the state of matter within the
                  star's interior, measure radii to an uncertainty of ±5%, reveal the stability of pulsars as clocks, research
                  the properties of matter outbursts, and understand how much energy is extracted from the intrinsic radiation,
                  spectra, and luminosities of the star.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The design of the telescope is very intentional. NICER needed to be sensitive to the vibrations and jolts of
                  the ISS, but insensitive to contamination and radiation from the space station. It needed to compress to stow
                  safely, yet provide a high observing efficiency, up to ~65%. It can measure the arrival of each X-ray within
                  100 nanoseconds.
                </p>

                <h4>Condensed-matter physics in a star’s core</h4>
                <p>
                  The research value of the core of neutron stars is in condensed state physics. Astrophysicists predict that
                  the interior exhibits superfluidity, meaning that the core is a liquid-like plasma with zero viscosity due to
                  its extremely high density and low temperatures. This “liquid” also means that the neutron star has
                  differential rotation, where different bands of the star rotate at different speeds. Momentum transfer in this
                  superfluid is created by scattering of electrons off neutrons bound to the superfluid's vortex cores.
                </p>

                <p>
                  NICER has made discoveries about this inner core of neutron stars, revealing what happens to matter on the
                  verge of imploding into a black hole. Neutron star J0740 showed that the core’s density crushes neutrons close
                  together, but further research is needed to confirm whether the neutrons stay intact or break down into
                  quarks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To put this density into perspective, a neutron star's mass is around 1.4× our Sun's, but the average radius is
                  only around 10–13 km. This extremely high density, and thus strong gravity, distorts spacetime around it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As soon as a neutron star collapses into a black hole, we lose all information we could gather about the exotic
                  matter it's composed of. NICER allows scientists to make groundbreaking physics research about these
                  rapidly-rotating stars in our Universe.

                <h3>Cold Atom Laboratory: Bose–Einstein Condensates in Orbit</h3>
                <span class="collapser-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
              </button>

                <p>
                  The Cold Atom Laboratory was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in May 2018. Its primary goal is
                  to study exotic states of matter that are difficult to observe on Earth for extended periods of time. One such
                  state occurs in gases cooled to extremely low temperatures, where the motion of atoms slows dramatically. At
                  these temperatures atoms no longer behave like individual particles but instead act like waves that overlap and
                  merge into a single, unified quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Conducting this research in space provides a key advantage. On Earth, the force of gravity causes the
                  condensate to disperse very quickly. However, in the microgravity environment of the ISS, the atomic “cloud”
                  can remain stable for much longer periods. This extended observation time allows scientists to perform more
                  precise measurements and experiments, deepening our understanding of quantum phenomena.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the experiments conducted by the Cold Atom Laboratory involves the creation of dual-species Bose–Einstein
                  condensates, which contain two different types of atoms within the same system. This was accomplished using
                  isotopes of rubidium and potassium through a process known as sympathetic cooling.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In sympathetic cooling, one atomic species that can be easily cooled by conventional techniques is used to cool
                  another species that is more difficult to bring to such low temperatures. On the ISS, the rubidium atoms were
                  first cooled through evaporative cooling, a process in which the most energetic atoms are allowed to escape,
                  lowering the average temperature of the remaining atoms. These ultracold rubidium atoms were then used to cool
                  the potassium atoms through direct thermal contact, enabling both species to reach the ultra-low temperatures
                  necessary to form condensates.
